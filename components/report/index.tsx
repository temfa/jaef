      <h2>REPORT ON APPLICANTS FOR THE 2024/2025 ACADEMIC SESSION JOSEPH ADARAMOLA EDUCATION SUPPORT FUND (6TH TRANCHE)</h2>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of Joseph Adaramola Education Support Fund is to provide succor, especially for the academically serious-minded and less privileged indigenes of
        Ibaram-Akoko who are currently studying in public higher institutions across Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.⁠ ⁠In order to ensure that the selection process of qualified candidates for the 2024/2025 academic session of the bursary award is transparent and objective, the Board
        of Trustees of Joseph Adaramola Education Support Fund took the following steps:
      </p>
      <p>
        Proper advertisement/announcement of the exercise on the Ibaram Community, Ibaram descendants Association (Akure Chapter) and Federation of Ibaram Students Union (FISU)
        WhatsApp platforms (24th January, 2025 & 16th February, 2025); Ensured that application forms were made available to interested candidates at different locations within and
        outside Ibaram; Ensured that enough time frame was given for the submission of completed application forms (1st March-31st August, 2025); Ensured that all duly returned
        application forms were properly scrutinized to determine qualified candidates arising from screening procedures; Transmission of interim brief (report) to the Federation of
        Ibaram Students Union (FISU) official WhatsApp platform to sensitize those candidates who did not comply with the instructions/requirements given in the application form to
        do the needful in order to facilitate the process (18th August, 2025).
      </p>
      <p>
        3.⁠ ⁠After a critical scrutiny of the applications submitted by the candidates, the Board of Trustees, based on the information provided as presented in the Analysis of
        Applications List, reveals that:
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>A total number of twelve (12) applications were obtained;</p>
        <p> A total number of eight (8) applications were filled and submitted;</p>
        <p>The eight (8) applicants who returned their application forms to the Foundation’s secretariat are categorized hereunder:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>GROUP A</h2>
        <p>
          This category is comprised of five (5) candidates who accompanied their forms with all the required documents and satisfied the criteria for qualification. Thus, they
          were considered qualified to benefit from the 6th tranche disbursement. They are: Rotimi Glory Precious, Awe Eniola Damilola, Oluwajobi Peace Oluwabukola, Adewale
          Omowonuola Lois and Ayodele Olayinka Temitope and Adesua Aderonke Esther.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>GROUP B</h2>
        <p>
          Kolade Blessing Busayo who failed to supply necessary documents, as well as vital information in her form is the sole candidate in this class. She was therefore
          disqualified.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>GROUP C</h2>
        <p>
          Ajakaye Oluwatumise Prescila is a student in a private higher institution, while her CGPA is below the standard threshold of 2.5. The applicant could not fulfill the
          conditions for qualification due to the stated reasons.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        4.⁠ ⁠Ultimately, the Board of Trustees recommended that the Six (6) applicants listed in Group A above are duly qualified to benefit from the 2024/2025 Academic Session
        Financial Support, being the 6th Tranche in the history of the foundation. In the interest of emphasis, the qualified applicants include; Rotimi Glory Precious, Awe Eniola
        Damilola, Oluwajobi Peace Oluwabukola, Adewale Omowonuola Lois and Ayodele Olayinka Temitope and Adesua Aderonke Esther. On the other hands Kolade Blessing Busayo and
        Ajakaye Oluwatumise Prescila detailed in Group B and C respectively were disqualified for reason given in each case under their respective group.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h2> OBSERVATION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES</h2>
        <p>
          It is disheartening to say that the Board of Trustees is displeased with the quantum level of levity attached by almost all the applicants to the processes of free form
          collection, completion and submission. Some applicants failed to complete the essential columns of the form, while majority did not accompany their returned forms with
          required documents. Going by normal screening process, only two (2) persons were qualified. Save for the extra strength and time deployed by the Board of Trustees,
          whereby many applicants were rescreened and rescreened through information/documents gathering, even, via relevant third parties, we would not have been able to attain
          the six (6) qualified applicants. It should be documented that the mindset of the Foundation cum the sole sponsor is to see encouraging number of applicants qualifying to
          benefit from the education support fund annually. On this note we call on parents to challenge their children to be more alive to every process of the yearly scheme.
